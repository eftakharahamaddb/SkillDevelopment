## Material Design 
### ToolBar, ActionBar, Menu, NavigationDrawer... :
Simply old time we were using ActionBar in our android app to maintain the navigationm but now days it is deprecated and a this term is replaced with AppBar.

To use the app bar we ..
1) Always use Any them of AppCompact witha Theme..... . NoActionBar. // Because we will stup our own app bar using ToolBar.
2) Craeate TollBar into seprate file, so that we can re use this toll bar according to our theme colors e..etc.
3) We can inflate the menu in that app bar, setup and enble home button, navigate to current to previuos activity using this button.
